- (IMPORTANT!!) make sure geometric distr on ops is correct
- give unique identifiers to leaves as well -- check that blank list is good after removals/adds
- replace children arrays with separate non pointers??
- less mallocs
- function for skeleton mallocs
- get rid of gen tree funcs that do nothing (in tree-utils)??
