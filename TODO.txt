- Fix MAKEFILE
- MAKE SURE REMOVE IS log(n) TIME!!
- Fine for now -- make sure geometric distr on ops is correct -- should weight users from init equally? (ALSO CHECK users list in test_driver and OOB_SEEDS for init)
- less mallocs
- REFACTOR!! - ex. : function for skeleton mallocs, destroy nodes, etc
- err checking crypto funcs?
- check path secrets for each user with tree??
- crypto struct
